UI/UX Demo Project
================================

Create a basic contact management app that allows me to keep track of sales leads at IWS. I meet people all the time at conferences, trade shows, business meetings, etc. and I need a way to keep track of who I have met, what they do, what their connection might be, etc.

Minimum Requirements
--------------------

 - Name
 - Position
 - Company
 - Phone
 - Email
 - Address
 - Picture
 - History of conversations I’ve had with this person
 - Reminders to follow up for anything interesting

Framework
---------

 - Use Bootstrap 3 for CSS Framework
 - Use knockout.js for the Javascript Framework
 - Use JQuery for any Javascript Knockout doesn’t handle

Primary Goal
------------

Your primary goal is to create an interface that is functional, intuitive, and extremely responsive. This app will be used primarily on a mobile device, but should translate just as well to the desktop. The interface you deliver should be fully interactive, but you can mock every single backend call if you’d like. I don’t actually care if the database / server side scripting does anything. I’m mostly interested in how well you design an interface that is intuitive and functional.

Bonus Points for anything else you can come up with that would be really helpful in an app like this. I can think of many additions that would make this really useful to our actual current sales team. Super Bonus points if your backend is hooked up and this app is legitimately useful.

Testing
-------

Capture video and feedback from multiple users at various stages of your design process and demonstrate that you understand how to incorporate user feedback into excellent design. The best designs are forged through the fires of real world user interaction. I want to see that you can analyze user feedback and incorporate it into your process.

Delivery
--------

Your final deliverables will be:
 - Functional app (Though a fully-functional app would be best case, we don't expect more than a fully functioning front-end using something like JSON-Server to serve the back-end responses.)
 - Well commented source code
 - Test documentation and videos

Feel free to share progress along the way. I’d love to see your process develop over the week or two that your are working on this. The more you share, the more I can steer you and make sure you don’t waste any time.
